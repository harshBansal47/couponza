"""System endpoints: liveness, readiness, metrics.

`/health` and `/health/deep` exist as two separate endpoints rather than one
with a query parameter, because they are asked by different things with
different costs. A load balancer polls liveness thousands of times a minute and
must not be able to turn a slow database into a restart storm. A deploy pipeline
asks the deep check once and genuinely needs to know about the database.

The deep check reports every dependency independently rather than failing fast,
so "is it the database or the scheduler?" is answerable from the response
instead of from a log dive.
