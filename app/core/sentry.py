"""Sentry wiring.

Deliberately a no-op unless `SENTRY_DSN` is set, so local runs and CI never
phone home and never pay the instrumentation cost.

Two choices worth stating:

* **No PII scrubbing by default, but PII is not sent.** Couponza's API handles
  email addresses and passwords. `send_default_pii=False` (the default here) is
  what keeps them out of Sentry; turning it on would ship every user's address
  to a third party on every error, which is a privacy incident and a
  compliance one, not a debugging convenience.
* **`traces_sample_rate` defaults low.** Full tracing on a coupon API is mostly
  noise. Errors are always reported; traces are sampled.
