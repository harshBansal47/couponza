# SQLite in memory by default, because it needs no server and a developer should
# be able to run the suite with one command and no setup.
#
# `TEST_DATABASE_URL` overrides it, and CI sets it to Postgres. That is not
# belt-and-braces: SQLite and Postgres disagree on the things this codebase most
# needs tested. Advisory locks do not exist on SQLite at all (so the scheduler
# silently takes the non-Postgres branch and the lock is never exercised), and
# SQLite hands back naive datetimes from `timestamptz` columns and ignores
# `Numeric` precision. A suite that only ever sees SQLite cannot catch a
# production-only failure in either.
#
# `DATABASE_URL` is deliberately *not* read here. This is a throwaway test
# database that gets dropped and recreated; pointing it at a developer's working
# `DATABASE_URL` would truncate their actual data.
#
# `TEST_DATABASE_SCHEMA` exists because a Postgres instance is often shared — a
# CI service container, or a laptop that also has a development database. Creating
# a schema is permitted far more often than creating a database, and a schema is
# isolated the same way for these purposes: `create_all` builds into it and
# `drop_all` removes only what it created.
