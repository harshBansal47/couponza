"""The scheduled work Couponza runs on itself.

Replaces the host-level cron scripts. The reason is not elegance: with cron,
whether ingestion runs at all depends on somebody having configured a crontab
on a particular box, and the failure mode is silence — a coupon database that
quietly goes stale while every page still renders normally. Running the schedule
inside the process means "it stopped working" shows up in the health check and
in the job table.

Design decisions worth defending:

* **Advisory locks, held across the whole job.** With N replicas, a naive
  scheduler has every replica ingesting the same sources at the same moment.
  The lock must be *session-scoped* (`pg_try_advisory_lock`, not the `_xact_`
  variant) because a transaction-scoped lock is released the instant the
  transaction that took it commits — which would leave the actual work
  unguarded. It is explicitly unlocked in a `finally`, because SQLAlchemy
  returns the connection to the pool on close and a pool rollback does not
  release advisory locks.
* **Every attempt gets a row, failures included.** A job that records only its
  successes is indistinguishable from a job that stopped running. `skipped` is
  recorded too, so the history does not show a gap on every non-leader replica.
* **`max_instances=1` plus `coalesce=True`.** A sweep that overruns its own
  interval must not stack a second copy behind itself; the missed tick is
  dropped and the next one proceeds normally.
