"""Prometheus metrics.

Hand-rolled rather than pulled from a framework because there is nothing to
instrument yet beyond "requests arrived" and "jobs ran" — and the honest version
of that is a dozen lines. The two things this module is careful about:

* **Cardinality is bounded.** Route labels are the *route template*
  (`/api/v1/coupons/{coupon_id}`), never the concrete path. Labelling by path is
  the single most common way to turn a Prometheus scrape into an out-of-memory
  kill of the metrics server, and it does not show up until someone queries a
  404-heavy path.
* **Instruments are registered once.** Prometheus's default registry raises on a
  duplicate metric name, which turns an import-order accident into an import
  error. Re-registering is a no-op instead.
